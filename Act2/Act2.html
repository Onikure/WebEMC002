        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            Hey, I'm Julian Morales, but you can call me Ian or Julian. I love playing video games like Valorant, Minecraft, and Mortal Kombat. I'm also into sports, especially badminton and volleyball.
            Right now, I'm in college, studying BSEMC (Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and Media Communication). It's all about blending my interests in tech, gaming, and talking to people.
            Whether I'm on the computer or the sports field, I'm always up for new challenges. Come along as I figure out this mix of games, studies, and everything in between!</p>

                        Volleyball is more than just a sport for me; it's a cherished escape, especially during stressful times. I've been immersed in the world of volleyball since my elementary school days, and it has become an integral part of my life. The rhythmic sound of the ball bouncing off the court, the strategic moves, and the camaraderie with teammates create a unique blend of excitement and tranquility.</p>

                        Juan Karlos has become my current favorite artist, and there's a profound connection between his music and my current state of mind. His songs resonate with the thoughts swirling in my head and capture the essence of what I'm going through. It's as if he puts into words the emotions that I find challenging to express.
