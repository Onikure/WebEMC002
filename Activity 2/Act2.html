        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm Julian Morales, but you can call me Ian or Julian. I love playing video games like Valorant, Minecraft, and Mortal Kombat. I'm also into sports, especially badminton and volleyball. Right now, I'm in college, studying BSEMC (Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and Media Communication). It's all about blending my interests in tech, gaming, and talking to people. Whether I'm on the computer or the sports field, I'm always up for new challenges. Come along as I figure out this mix of games, studies, and everything in between!</p>
